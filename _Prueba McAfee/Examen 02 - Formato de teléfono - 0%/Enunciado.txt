We are given a string S representing a phone number, which we would like to 
reformat. String S consists of N characters: digits, spaces and/or dashes.
It contains at least two digits.

Spaces and dashes in string S can be ignores. We want to reformat the given 
phonenumber in such a way that the digits are grouped in blocks of length
three, separated by single dashes. If necessary, the final block or the 
last tow blocks can be of length two.

For example, given string S = "00-44 48 5555 8361", we would like to format
it as "004-448-555-583-61".

write a function:
    function solution (S);

that, given a string S representing a phone number, returns this phone 
reformatted as described above.

For example, given S = "00-44 48 5555 8361", the function should return 
"004-448-555-583-61". Given S = "0 - 22 1985 - - 324", the function should 
return "022-198-53-24". Given "555372654", the function should return
"555-372-654".

Assume that:
    * N is an integer within the range [2..100];
    * string S consists only of digits (0-9), spaces and/or dashes(-);
    * string S contains at leas two digits.

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution 
will not be a focus of the assessment
